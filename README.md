# BeautifulSoup
Using BeautifulSoup to extract data from FIFA rankings website.

Website: https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/rank=20/index.html

This website contains rankings, overall points, 3 month weighted average points for Men's Football.

I have used BeautifulSoup to generate a csv which combines data from different pages of the website. This data can be then used for predicting FIFA rankings, Match results etc.
